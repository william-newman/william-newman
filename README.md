### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

## I am actively looking for remote work and/or work in the Denver area.

Versed in Javascript, Java, React, Angular, Typescript, Sassy CSS, HTML, Ruby, and Python.

Owner and admin for killerkuff.com, a website I built using Angular and Firebase for my stepdad to showcase his art.

Some past projects include a full-feature messaging/social site, an e-commerce site, a games & trivia site, and a medical data visualization site.

Always looking for new projects.
